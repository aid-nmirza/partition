<p>INTRODUCTION</p>


<p>The story of partition is often told beginning in 1947, a year in which the South Asian subcontinent erupted in what Western primates have dubbed “sectarian violence.” </p>

<p>According to commonly accepted narratives on the subject, it was at this time that “Hindus and Sikhs” entered into a bloody conflict with “Indian Muslims,” despite the “harmonious co-existence” of these populations prior to the fact. What is disguised by this narrative are the targeted efforts by the British Empire to undermine Indian self-determination, including the willful misrepresentation of the participant groups and conclusions of Partition.</p>

<p>In reality, a complex set of determinations informed the political struggles which lead to partition. The ethnic, political, and religious boundaries of the landmass are significantly more porous and multi-faceted than is often described. The abundance of self-determining princedoms was one such confounding factor. Hyderabad, for example, constituted a small Muslim princedom squarely in what was determined to be "Indian" territory. The immense ethnic diversity and relative peace on the continent also allowed for freedom of movement between territories, leading to greater dispersal and intermingling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, British efforts to depict different ethnic groups on the continent as naturally opposed and incapable of co-operative self-government have been largely successful. In result of this, foreigners are often unable to recognise the affinities in the cultures of India and Pakistan. This project aims to highlight some of the difficulties in unpacking this history, as well as re-introduce some of the cultural nuance which has been wrung so violently from the conflict.</p>

<p>In the course of participation, you will be asked to enter into a number of negotiations which were pertinent to residents of the subcontinent at the time of partition. This puzzle does not accept right answers.</p>
