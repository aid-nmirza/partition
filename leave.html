<p>In result of the Partition hearings, the Muslim League left India in 1947 under the leadership of Muhammed Ali Jinnah. Jinnah saw the decision to leave India not as an issue of ethnicity or religion, but of political self-determination. While Jinnah was originally opposed to Partition, he believed Congress would not support a sufficient degree of self-government for political minorities. These included formerly independent princedoms, many of whom were not guaranteed their independence under Partition agreements. </p>
