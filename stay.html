<p>In result of the Partition hearings, Indian Congress Party declared independence from the British Empire in 1947 under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru saw the leadership of a new India not as an issue of ethnicity or religion, but of political self-determination. While Nehru acknowledged the importance of ethnic diversity in India, he believed that India could not withstand sectarian division. For this reason, he encouraged formerly independent princedoms to sign on to Congress party in the wake of Independence. </p>
