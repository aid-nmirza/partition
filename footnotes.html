<p><i>Welcome to the footnotes! Thank you so much for reading through this project. Here, I have included some text in order to better support language I have used in this project. </i></p>

<p>This work has developped from an experience I had in a class on South Asian art, in which a British documentary was offered as an "objective" perspective on Partition. I take issue with this contention, which springs from the paternalistic deprecation of memory in favour of written records. Furthermore, this neglects the long-standing British colonial maxim: divide and conquer. Even in quitting India, the Empire attempted to sow the seeds of conflict to justify continued Neocolonial exploitation.</p> 

<p>There are no records of my family members who were lost during the violence. This direct and partisan experience of violence is characteristic of the experiences of those South Asians on the subcontinent, and not Euro-American historians. Therefore, as someone directly affected by the conflict, I am in a better position to offer a perspective on Partition than any "objective" source.</p>

INTRODUCTION

<p>i - In using the term "Western primates" to describe British historians of Partition, I am mimicking the paternalistic tone which overwhelms Euro-American perspectives on race and ethnicity, in the history of Partition and beyond. In particular, the zoological designation parallels the language used to describe barriers to entry of many buildings during British colonial rule: "No Dogs or Indians." </p>

<p>ii - In examining the history of Partition, critical insights into British motivations are indispensable to expanding the dialogue. Although the Muslim league is often charged with "breaking" India, it is important to bear in mind that a British barister drew the lines of the border. British colonial rule was a determining factor in many of the decisions taken in the wake of partition, as well as the identity projects of the anti-colonial Quit India movement as a whole. </p>

<p>CHOICE I </p>

<p>iii - Although they appear a world apart, Jinnah and Gandhi are both British-educated lawyers of Gujarati ethnic background. During the course of education and trade work, both men would therefore have been accustomed to formal Western dress. </p>

<p>The choice of a dhoti as a return to Indian identity may seem obvious at first. However, despite the affinity in their cultural backgrounds, Jinnah could not have chosen to wear this particular article. As a Muslim, the article would not have been a vernacular dress within his arsenal. In fact, by wearing a dhoti without a shirt, Gandhi related his image and vision for India to Hindu spirituality.</p> 

<p>Gandhi's choice to essentialise Indian dress with a uniquely Hindu article might therefore be problematised. On the other hand, the obvious advantages of such an approach are detailed on the main page. </p>

<p>CHOICE II </p>

<p>iv - While Urdu is mutually intelligible with Hindi, one of the most spoken langauges on the subcontinent, its written form and formal registers recall the Muslim domination of the Mughal Sultanate. Therefore, even though many Hindu people in the provinces of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar would speak Urdu, it is not an obvious choice for the langauge of a multi-ethnic nation. In particular, it was not normally spoken in Punjab, Sindh, or East Bengalâ€” the areas which became East and West Pakistan (later Bangladesh). </p>

<p>Like the dhoti, Urdu is an Indian choice and defies the perpetuation of the British colonial standards. Similarly, like the dhoti, it is a political choice which prioritises certain kinds of identities over others. </p>

<p>CHOICE III </p>

<p>v - In result of partition hearings, the nation building project of India split into two separate projects. Both states attempted to lay the groundwork for secular and multi-ethnic national identities. The extent to which this has been accomplished is unfortunately limited, as is clear by the groundwork established above.</p>
