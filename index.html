<p>INTRODUCTION</p>


<p>The story of partition is often told beginning in 1947, a year in which the South Asian subcontinent erupted in what Western primates have dubbed “sectarian violence.” 

<p>According to commonly accepted narratives on the subject, it was at this time that “Hindus and Sikhs” entered into a bloody conflict with “Indian Muslims,” despite the “harmonious co-existence” of these populations prior to the fact. What is disguised by this narrative are the targeted efforts by the British Empire to undermine Indian self-determination, including the willful misrepresentation of the participant groups and conclusions of Partition.</p>

<p>This project aims to highlight some of the difficulties in unpacking this history, as well as re-introduce some of the cultural nuance which has been wrung so violently from the conflict.</p>

<p>In the course of participation, you will be asked to enter into a number of negotiations which were pertinent to residents of the subcontinent at the time of partition. This puzzle does not accept right answers.</p>
