<p>Mahatma Gandhi, an important nationalist figure in Indian history, is famous for his polemic regarding Indian hand-spun clothing and the garment known as the dhoti. Gandhi’s choice to wear a dhoti reflected his British training as a lawyer. </p>
   
<p>Gandhi’s decision to wear traditional clothing might be puzzling, considering his training as a British lawyer. In fact, the garment highlights Gandhi’s rejection of British systems of valuation. Gandhi fought battles primarily in people’s hearts, publicly ‘othering’ himself to the British in order to inspire people to reclaim their Indian identities. Gandhi insisted that colonial infrastructure acknowledge the importance of his cultural background, and the strength of Indian culture independently of the British. In this gesture, Gandhi rejected the paternalism of the British empire and established new expectations about what it means to be Indian. </p>
