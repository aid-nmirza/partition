<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Before British occupation of the South Asian sub-continent, there was no affiliative national, political, or ethnic entity such as "India." The results of the nation building project have been englightening at turns, and devastating at others. Through anti-colonial projects, many peoples of the subcontinent have recognised affinities with one another. On the other hand, the nation-building project has required that various ethnic identities and political alignments be silenced or exiled in favour of internal cohesion. </p>

<p>These considerations are especially pertinent today, as India enters a new era of political intimidation and coercion against its minority populations. Despite the immense grief and devastation of Partition, many are convinced by the contemporary political climate that the schism was a necessary step to prevent total elimination of certain groups. </p>

<p>The project of defining India, and later Pakistan and Bangladesh, was first and foremost and anti-colonial struggle. As in any post-colonial landscape, attempts to characterise the situation with "objectivity" lead to insurmountable fallacies.</p>

<p>That said, there is one ethnic and political alignment uniquely indisposed and unsuited to attaining objectivity. This is that of the Western primate. For this reason, footnotes have been provided to accompany you on your next playthrough. </p>
